**Based on all the information found while working with the data in SQL,
I decided to import:**

-   data that includes only `classic_bike` and `electric_bike`

Connecting to the database/getting the data

``` r
con <- dbConnect(RPostgres::Postgres(),
                 dbname = 'divvy-tripdata', 
                 host = "localhost", 
                 port = 5432, 
                 user = "postgres",
                 password = getPass())
```

``` r
query = "
  SELECT 
    m.member_type,
    b.bike_type,
    s1.station_name AS start_station_name,

          ON t.bike_type_id = b.id
      JOIN station_names s1

Checking the retrieved data

Splitting columns `started_time` and `ended_time` into:

-   year - for year (e.g., 2022)

-   month - for month (e.g., August)

-   day - for day of the week (e.g., Monday)

-   start\_hour - for hour (e.g., 19)

-   start\_minute - for minutes (e.g., 02)

-   end\_hour - for hour (e.g., 19)

-   end\_minute - for minutes (e.g., 02)

``` r
data$year <- format(data$started_time, "%Y")

data$month <- format(data$started_time, "%B")

data$day <- format(data$started_time, "%A")
```

Converting `month` and `day` into factors (when plotting they will be
orgered correctlly)

``` r
data$month <- factor(data$month,
                     levels = c("October", "November", "December", "January", 
                                "February", "March", "April", "May", "June",

Visualizing `duration_minuts`

``` r

  geom_boxplot(aes(x = duration_minutes, fill = "#0c4c8a")) +
  labs( title = "Bike Usage Time", x = "Minutes") +
  theme( legend.position = "none")
```

Percentiles

``` r
quantile(data$duration_minutes)
```

    ##      0%     25%     50%     75%    100% 
    ##    1.00    6.32   10.70   18.65 1499.90

Descriptive statistics for `duration_minuts`

``` r
psych::describe(data$duration_minutes)
```

    ##    vars       n  mean    sd median trimmed  mad min    max  range  skew
    ## X1    1 4179035 16.26 26.85   10.7   12.49 7.86   1 1499.9 1498.9 21.65
    ##    kurtosis   se

Looking at the maximum duration for 95% of the time

``` r
upper_bound <- quantile(data$duration_minutes, 0.95)
upper_bound
```

    ##   95% 
    ## 43.72

Itâ€™s clear that variable `duration_minutes` is right skewed based on the
mean (16.26) and trimmed mean (12.49)

I doubt there are people that use the bikes for up to 1000+ minutes (16+
hours)

Even if they do these are clear outliers, I mean the pricing is steep:

-   members :

    -   classic bikes ($119 per year):

        -   unlocking the bike - free
        -   usage - free 45 minutes at a time
        -   over 45 minutes is $0.16 per minute

    -   electric bikes ($119 per year)

        -unlocking the bike - free

        -   usage - $0.16 per minute
        -   parking has extra charges based on location

-   casual:

    -   classic bikes:

        -   unlocking the bike - $1
        -   usage - $0.16 per minute

    -   electric bikes

        -unlocking the bike - $1

        -   usage - $0.39 per minute
        -   parking has extra charges based on location

There is also a third category of users which are casual members that
get a `daily pass`. They have 3 hours of free rides for 24 hours for
classic bikes.

The battery of an electric bike lasts maximum for 60 miles. If we assume
that the person rides one non-stop at a maximum speed of 3 hours, thay
have enough battery only for 3 hours.

Based on all of the above I decided to remove all that have a duration
above 43.72 minutes. Meaning, removing 5% (208,951 values) from the
data.

``` r
clean_data <- data %>% filter(duration_minutes <= 43.72 )
```

Visualizing cleaned data

``` r

Visualizing duration by group and bike type

``` r
ggplot(clean_data, aes(x = member_type, y = duration_minutes, fill = member_type)) +

Mean for each group by usage of bike type

``` r

                                                           list(mean = "mean"))
```

    ## # A tibble: 4 x 3
    ## # Groups:   member_type [2]
    ##   member_type bike_type      mean
    ##   <chr>       <chr>         <dbl>
    ## 1 casual      classic_bike   15.8
    ## 2 casual      electric_bike  13.7
    ## 3 member      classic_bike   12.1
    ## 4 member      electric_bike  10.6

Looks like on average casual users tend to use the bikes for a longer
period of time.

<span style="color:blue">**Bike usage by month for each group**</span>

Plot the difference in usage of bikes by month

``` r
ggplot(clean_data) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = month, fill = member_type, color = member_type), position = position_dodge(width=0.5)) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Bikes Usage", subtitle = "Bike Type and User Type", caption = "Past 12 mth") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=25)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = function(x) format(x, scientific = FALSE)) +
  facet_wrap(~bike_type)
```

Based on the plot above we see that the only time when the casual users
use the services more than the members is in the month of July for
electric bikes.Potentially because of summer tourists.

Another factor for bike usages could be the weather.

Casual users contingency table by month and type of bike
